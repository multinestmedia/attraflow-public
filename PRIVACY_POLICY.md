# Privacy Policy for AttraFlow

Effective Date: December 1, 2025

## Introduction

At AttraFlow, your privacy is paramount. This is a **privacy-first application** where all your data stays on your device. We designed AttraFlow to give you complete control over your personal information.

## Your Data Stays Local

**AttraFlow stores all data locally on your device using browser storage (localStorage).** This means:

- Your daily check-in data never leaves your device
- Your attraction patterns, feelings, and notes remain private
- We have no servers collecting or storing your personal information
- We cannot access your data - only you can

## What Data is Stored Locally

The following information is stored exclusively in your browser's localStorage:

- **Daily Submissions:** Date, attraction levels, gender feelings, position/role preferences, and personal notes
- **App Preferences:** Theme settings (light/dark mode), sidebar state
- **No Account Data:** No usernames, emails, passwords, or identifying information is collected

## Data You Control

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- **Full Ownership:** You own 100% of your data
- **Export Capability:** You can export your data at any time (feature available in Data Table)
- **Delete Anytime:** Clear your browser data or use the app's delete functions to remove entries
- **No Recovery:** If you clear your browser data, your information cannot be recovered (we don't have backups because we never see your data)

## No Data Collection

We do **NOT** collect, transmit, or store any data on external servers, including:

- Personal information
- Usage analytics
- Tracking cookies
- Device information
- Location data

## Third-Party Services

**Error Tracking and Monitoring (Sentry):**

AttraFlow uses Sentry, a third-party error tracking service, to help us identify and fix bugs, crashes, and performance issues. This service collects:

- **Technical Error Data:** JavaScript errors, error messages, stack traces, and browser information
- **Performance Metrics:** Page load times, API response times, and application performance data
- **Usage Context:** Actions leading up to an error (anonymized breadcrumbs)
- **Session Replays:** In case of errors, anonymized recordings of user interactions (with all text and media masked for privacy)

**What Sentry Does NOT Collect:**

- Your personal check-in data (attraction levels, feelings, notes)
- Your identity, name, email, or contact information
- Any data stored in your browser's localStorage
- Specific content you enter into forms

**Data Protection Measures:**

- All error data is sent over secure HTTPS connections
- Text content in error recordings is automatically masked
- Error tracking can be disabled in development mode
- We configure Sentry to minimize data collection and focus on technical diagnostics
- Sentry's privacy policy: [https://sentry.io/privacy/](https://sentry.io/privacy/)

**Why We Use Error Tracking:**

Error tracking helps us provide a better experience by allowing us to:
- Quickly identify and fix bugs before they affect many users
- Understand which features need improvement
- Ensure the app works reliably across different browsers and devices

AttraFlow does not currently integrate with any analytics platforms or advertising networks.

## Browser Storage Limitations

Please be aware:

- Data persists only in the browser/device where you entered it
- Clearing browser data will delete all your AttraFlow entries
- Private/incognito mode may not persist data after closing the browser
- Data is not synced across devices

## Future Changes

If we ever decide to implement optional cloud backup, data sync, or analytics:

- These features will be **opt-in only**
- We will update this policy with clear explanations
- You will be notified and asked for explicit consent
- Local-only operation will always remain an option

## Your Rights

You have complete control:
- Access all your data within the app
- Export your data as needed
- Delete individual entries or all data
- Use the app without creating an account
- Stop using the app at any time without consequences

This policy reflects our commitment to your privacy and autonomy. Your personal data belongs to you, and we built AttraFlow to keep it that way.
